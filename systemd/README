This directory contains files that can be used to run TAGMremotectrl
as a service on systems supporting systemd (e.g. RHEL7).

This only makes sense to run on gluon28 which has a dedicated ethernet
NIC for this communication.

To use do the following:

1. Copy TAGMremotectrl.service and TAGMremotectrl.service.d to /etc/systemd/system


2. Enable the service by running the following as sudo/root:

      systemctl enable TAGMremotectrl


You can then check the status with "systemctl status TAGMremotectrl".
You can disable the service by running the following as sudo/root:

      systemctl disable TAGMremotectrl

You can also check the log of output with:

  journalctl -u TAGMremotectrl.service
